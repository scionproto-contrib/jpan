/**
 * Scenarios to consider:<br>
 * - A policy may change ordering of paths (e.g. live latency measurements)<br>
 * - A policy may or may not be used concurrently by multiple channels/sockets. We can probably
 * assume that concurrent usage doesn't coincide with live updates.<br>
 * - live updates make only sense if the destination AS is known and fixed<br>
 * - concurrent usage is much less likely to go to the same AS<br>
 *
 * <p>Q: facility to blacklist paths? -> Less useful when combined with live measurements.
 *
 * <p>We should always return a list of paths, e.g. useful for<br>
 * - Multi-path <br>
 * - Dropping a path if it turns out to be erroneous<br>
 *
 * <p>Idea:<br>
 * - A path "filter" is static, i.e. has no state (or at least no state that can change). It can do
 * ordering by metadata or apply requirements based on metadata<br>
 * - A path "supplier" has a destination. It can refresh paths if they expire. It can do live
 * measurements to reorder paths or remove them.<br>
 *
 * <p>A supplier may just have a path container. We just call get() to get a path everytime we need
 * a path. SimpleSupplier:
 *
 * <p>Dynamic supplier:<br>
 * - refreshNow()? refreshAllExpired()?<br>
 * - hasNew()? This doesn't really work in a concurrent setting. Maybe hasNew(dateLastUsed)? Or
 * register a callback?<br>
 * - getPath()/getPaths()<br>
 * - Should be able to automatically use a given Service.<br>
 * - concurrent usage?<br>
 * - Should be able to process live metrics from actual traffic? E>g. traffic gets slower -> find
 * another paths with lower latency (assume it is a path problem, not a server problem)
 *
 * <p>Static supplier?<br>
 * - Has a service, refreshes when expired.<br>
 * - Possibility to blacklist paths (or directly handle SCMP errors)
 *
 * <p>Multi-AS thoughts supplier should use a service (where the service should in future be able to
 * hold multiple ASes) or a service factory (use daemon/topofile/...) where each new service has
 * exactly one AS...? (that doesn't work with topo files...). -> manually supplied topofiles are
 * unlikely in an AS-switching environment AS switching occurs for mobile devices, i.e. without
 * daemon or manual topo files).
 *
 * <p>send()/write()<br>
 * - send(x, SSA) should send to given path (potentially use map with refreshed paths, see
 * ScionDatagramChannel)<br>
 * - send(x, ISA) should use PP to get path <br>
 * - write(x) should use PP to get path <br>
 *
 * <p>Unfortunately, the PathPolicyHandler works only for a fixed destination, i.e. only for
 * connect()/write(). Using it for send() would require multiple instances, one for each
 * destination.
 *
 * <p>Expected behaviour of send()/write():<br>
 * - send(x, SSA): autorefresh path? -> could be cached in "refreshedMap". Attach PathPolicy to SSA?
 * Or we could try to refresh, looking for identical paths to what SSA contains....<br>
 * - send(x, Path): autorefresh path? MUST try to use identical path. could be cached in
 * "refreshedMap"<br>
 * - send(x, ISA): lookup path. Could be cached. Uses PathPolicy<br>
 * - connect(path): autorefresh path? MUST try to use identical path!<br>
 * - connect(ISA): lookup path. Uses PathPolicy<br>
 *
 * <p>autorefresh: How to deal with dynamic path policies?<br>
 * With autorefresh, we should just ignore paths that are close to expiry....?<br>
 * We need to document the behaviour:<br>
 * - send(x, Path) / connect(Path) is the strictest, it will automatically refresh the path, but
 * only with identical paths.<br>
 * - send(x, ISA) / connect(ISA) will use the path policy to get a path.<br>
 * - send(x, SSA) needs to be decided. We could attach a PathPolicy, but we could also try to find
 * identical paths (emulating the path policy). We could also decide to use this only for
 * ResponsePaths....?<br>
 *
 * <p>The dynamic path policy should handle expiry internally. If we get 100 path, some of them will
 * always be close to expiry. We should probably ignore them.<br>
 * - The DPP acts as a path cache. How often should we refresh? -> Good question. <br>
 * - try refreshing. How does it work? At what point can we expect a fresh path from the CS? How
 * close must it be to expiry?<br>
 *
 * @deprecated Needs work.
